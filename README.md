This project was for image classification
I had to come up with a concept for image detection, and it was my impression that a model for google captcha could certainly make good use out of the theme
The accuracy went haywire, it would seem to seamlessly improve with time and suddenly make a divergent shift, rendering highly inconsistent results
I plan to explore where I went wrong again
